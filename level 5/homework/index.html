<h1>hello i m gonna talk about 5 most basic languanges in programming</h1>

<h2>python</h2>
<p>Python was invented in the late 1980s[42] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to <br>
    the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[43] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[12] Its<br>
     implementation began in December 1989.[44] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he <br>
     announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL), a title the Python<br>
      community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[45] (he's since come out of retirement and is <br>
      self-titled "BDFL-emeritus"). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a <br>
      five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[46][47]</p>

<h2>html</h2>
<p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In <br>
    1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late<br>
     1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for <br>
    funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990,<br>
    Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]</p>

<h2>ruby</h2>
<p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed with an emphasis on <br>
    programming productivity and simplicity. In Ruby, <br>
    everything is an object, including primitive data types. It was developed in the mid-1990s<br>
     by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.</p>

<h2>java script</h2>
<p>The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent <br>
    role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web.[12] The lead<br>
     developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, <br>
     Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[13]</p>

<h2>java</h2>
<p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[21] Java was<br>
     originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[22] The language was <br>
     initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee,<br>
      a type of coffee from Indonesia.[23] Gosling designed Java with<br>
     a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.[24]</p>
